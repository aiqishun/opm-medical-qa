# Example QA Demo

Run:

```bash
python scripts/run_qa.py --question "What causes myocardial infarction?"
```

Example output:

```text
answer:
Myocardial infarction can be caused by atherosclerosis that leads to coronary artery blockage and reduced blood flow to heart tissue.

explanation:
In this rule-based example, atherosclerosis contributes to plaque build-up in the coronary arteries. This can narrow or block the artery, reduce blood flow, and deprive heart muscle of oxygen, which may lead to myocardial infarction.

reasoning path:
Atherosclerosis -> Coronary artery blockage -> Reduced blood flow -> Myocardial infarction
```

This demo is intentionally simple. It shows the shape of the future system:
an answer supported by an explainable path from a small cardiology knowledge
base.
